```
#web interface port
server.port=80
#database URL
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/parkin
#database login
spring.datasource.username=your_login
#database password
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```
* Setup your parking lot by editing default database entries inside data.sql file
```
--values: 0, fee/h (basic period), basic period, fee/h (extended period)
insert into tariffs values(0, 10, 2, 8) on conflict do nothing;
